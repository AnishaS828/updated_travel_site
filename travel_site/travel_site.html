The fountain is near lots of shopping areas and nightlife, and there is a tradition of throwing coins into the fountain. The tradition uses three coins, each with a different purpose - one to guarantee a return to Rome, one to fall in love in Rome, and one to happily marry there. If such traditions interest you, then the Trevi Fountain will be a fun experience. Visiting the Trevi Fountain is free and won’t take long.</p>
